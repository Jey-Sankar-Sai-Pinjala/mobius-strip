# mobius-strip
Code Structure
Class-based design (MobiusStrip) for clean modularity.

compute_mesh() builds the 3D surface using parametric equations.

compute_surface_area() approximates area via cross product of partial derivatives.

compute_edge_length() measures the length of both boundary curves.

plot() visualizes the twist using matplotlib.

Captures the true area despite the Möbius twist.

Based on gradient-based vector calculus.

Challenges Faced
One side, two edges? Needed to define boundaries clearly for edge length.

Numerical stability: Ensured accuracy using np.gradient.

Seamless wrapping at u = 0 and u = 2π to avoid mesh cracks.

Visualization
The 3D plot isn't just pretty — it's proof of a continuous, twisted, non-orientable surface.
